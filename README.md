# Continuos-Authentication-Using-Mouse-Dynamics-Behavioral-Biometrics
This project uses mouse movement patterns to identify users through behavioral biometrics. By preprocessing raw data into movement sequences, we train LSTM/BiLSTM models for both binary and multiclass classification, enabling passive, secure user authentication.
